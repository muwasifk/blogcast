<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Over the years I’ve worked on several different projects and am currently working on a few as well. Here’s a list with some summaries.</p>

<h4 id="uct"><span style="color:rgba(61, 151, 230, 0.916)"><strong>UCT</strong></span></h4>

<p>The project I spent the most time on is the  <strong>United Computing Tournament</strong> (UCT). UCT is an organisation based in Ottawa which hosts computing contests but in a different format than other contests (such as USACO and CCC). You can learn more at <a href="https://theuct.ca">our website</a>.</p>

<p>I worked primarily on the backend, which we wrote in Go, and also helped out with the frontend using Tailwind.</p>
